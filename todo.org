DHCPAWN TODO LIST

* encapsulate LDAP timeout and server_down exceptions
 in order to be able to retry ldap entry creation if it fails.
 for now, i will try until success (perhaps set a timeout limit of 5 min? )


* Improve ldap_delete by adding the retry option
in cases where the operation gets an exception/fails for some reasons.

* improve ldap_add by adding the retry option
in cases where the operation gets an exception/fails for some reasons.

* Update README to include usage cases examples for:
- single host registration
- single host deletion
- multiple host registration
- multiple host deletion
- single host update
- multiple hosts update ??

* Update README to include a simple cheetsheet for code changes to deployment
- change code locally
- build image with a new tag (or use docker-compose)
- load project locally to test changes
- once changes look good, push image to registry
- on dhcpawn server ,run docker pull and docker-compose restart ?
